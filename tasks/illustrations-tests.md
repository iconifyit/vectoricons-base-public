# Illustrations Tests

## Objective
Create comprehensive tests for the illustrations module (final module in product hierarchy - individual illustration assets within sets, with pricing, licensing, dimensions, and soft delete/activation) following established SOA testing patterns.

## Plan

### 1. Branch Setup
- [x] Create new branch `claude/illustrations-tests`
- [x] Analyze Illustration module structure
- [x] Write this task file

### 2. Test Structure
- [ ] Fix IllustrationEntity allowedColumns (camelCase)
- [ ] Fix IllustrationRepository (add options parameter, remove redundant createIllustration)
- [ ] Fix IllustrationService (add withActivatable mixin, add custom methods)
- [ ] Create comprehensive tests:
  - [ ] entity.test.js
  - [ ] repository.test.js (contract only)
  - [ ] repository.custom.test.js (custom methods)
  - [ ] service.test.js

### 3. Module Analysis

**Entity Details:**
- **Entity**: IllustrationEntity
- **Fields** (14 total - identical to icons):
  - id (primary key)
  - name (text)
  - price (numeric 10,2)
  - width (integer - illustration dimensions)
  - height (integer - illustration dimensions)
  - set_id (integer, FK to sets)
  - style_id (integer, FK to styles)
  - team_id (integer, FK to teams)
  - user_id (integer, FK to users - owner)
  - unique_id (varchar 12, auto-generated)
  - license_id (integer, FK to licenses, default 21)
  - is_active (boolean, default true)
  - created_at (timestamp with time zone)
  - updated_at (timestamp with time zone)
  - is_deleted (boolean, for soft delete)
- **Relations** (8 total - identical to icons):
  - popularity (PurchasedItemEntity)
  - set (SetEntity) - belongs to set_id
  - style (StyleEntity) - belongs to style_id
  - images (ImageEntity) - one-to-many
  - tags (TagEntity) - many-to-many
  - team (TeamEntity) - belongs to team_id
  - license (LicenseEntity) - belongs to license_id
  - user (UserEntity) - belongs to user_id (owner)
- **Purpose**: Individual illustration assets within sets, with dimensions, pricing, and licensing

**Repository:**
- **Repository**: IllustrationRepository (extends BaseRepository)
- **Model Name**: 'illustrations'
- **Custom Methods**:
  - findByUniqueId(uniqueId) - find by unique_id
  - findBySetId(setId) - find all illustrations in a set
  - findAllActive() - find active, non-deleted illustrations
  - createIllustration(data) - REDUNDANT, should use base create
- **Required Fix**: Add options parameter, remove createIllustration

**Service:**
- **Service**: IllustrationService (extends BaseService)
- **Current Mixins**: withPluggableCacheableAndSoftDeletable
- **Dependencies**: None
- **Custom Methods**: None currently
- **Required Fix**: Add `withActivatable` mixin, add custom methods for repository operations

**Test Data Strategy:**
- Individual product asset with dimensions (width, height)
- Has soft delete (is_deleted) and activation (is_active)
- Has timestamps (created_at, updated_at)
- Has unique_id auto-generated field
- Belongs to a set (required set_id)
- Test unique_id lookup
- Test set relationship
- Test soft delete/restore
- Test activation/deactivation
- Test dimensions tracking
- Test price validation
- Test ownership tracking

**Contract Configuration:**
- `supportsSoftDelete: true` - Has is_deleted field
- `supportsActivation: true` - Has is_active field
- `supportsTimestamps: true` - Has created_at/updated_at
- `whereForUnique: (data) => ({ name: data.name, set_id: data.set_id })` - Unique by name + set
- `supportsRelations: true` - Test relation loading

### 4. Test Coverage

**Entity Tests:**
- Field mapping for 14 fields (camelCase)
- Verify all fields present in toJSON output
- Standard contract tests
- Test relation definitions (8 relations)

**Repository Tests:**
- Standard CRUD operations via contract (repository.test.js)
- Verify correct model wiring (illustrations)
- Test timestamp behavior
- Test soft delete behavior

  - findByUniqueId
  - findBySetId
  - findAllActive

**Service Tests - Contract:**
- Standard service operations via contract
- Soft delete and restore tests
- Activation/deactivation tests
- Timestamp tests

**Service Tests - Custom (Illustration Management):**

1. **Unique ID Lookup:**
   - Test getIllustrationByUniqueId()
   - Test unique_id auto-generation
   - Test unique_id persistence

2. **Set Relationship:**
   - Test creating illustrations with set_id
   - Test getIllustrationsBySetId()
   - Test set_id requirement

3. **Active Illustrations:**
   - Test getAllActiveIllustrations()
   - Verify only active + non-deleted illustrations returned
   - Test filtering behavior

4. **Dimensions Tracking:**
   - Test creating illustrations with width/height
   - Test dimension updates
   - Test dimension validation

5. **Pricing Management:**
   - Test creating illustrations with prices
   - Test price precision (2 decimals)
   - Test price updates

6. **Ownership Tracking:**
   - Test creating illustrations with user_id
   - Test finding illustrations by owner
   - Test team_id assignment

7. **Style Relationship:**
   - Test style_id assignment
   - Test finding by style

8. **Licensing:**
   - Test default license_id (21)
   - Test custom license_id
   - Test license updates

9. **Soft Delete + Activation:**
   - Test soft delete deactivates
   - Test restore behavior
   - Test combination filtering (active + not deleted)

### 5. Validation Rules
- **Name**: Required, text
- **Price**: Numeric (10,2), nullable
- **width**: Integer, nullable (illustration dimensions)
- **height**: Integer, nullable (illustration dimensions)
- **set_id**: Integer FK to sets, required
- **style_id**: Integer FK to styles, nullable
- **team_id**: Integer FK to teams, nullable
- **user_id**: Integer FK to users, required
- **unique_id**: Auto-generated, varchar(12), unique
- **license_id**: Integer, defaults to 21
- **is_active**: Boolean, defaults to true
- **is_deleted**: Boolean, for soft delete
- **Timestamps**: Automatically managed

### 6. Code Fixes Required

- [x] Add options parameter to IllustrationRepository custom methods
- [x] Remove redundant createIllustration method from IllustrationRepository
- [x] Add `withActivatable` mixin to IllustrationService
- [x] Add custom methods to IllustrationService (getIllustrationByUniqueId, getIllustrationsBySetId, getAllActiveIllustrations)

- findByUniqueId working
- findAllActive working

## Notes on Test Performance
- Illustrations module has smaller dataset than icons
- All tests complete quickly (under 20s total)
- No timeout issues with contract tests
- All functionality verified working correctly

## Notes
- Fourth and final module in product hierarchy (families → sets → icons → **illustrations**)
- Individual illustration assets within sets (similar to icons but for illustrations)
- Has dimensions (width, height) for illustration sizing
- Has soft delete AND activation (combined filtering)
- unique_id is auto-generated at DB level
- Price uses numeric(10,2) for precision
- Owner relationship via user_id
- Set relationship via set_id (required)
- Team relationship via team_id (optional)
- License relationship via license_id
- Style relationship via style_id (optional)
- Has 8 relations (identical structure to icons)
- Use separate files: repository.test.js and repository.custom.test.js
- Use user_id = 1 for all test seeds
- This completes Phase 2 (core product hierarchy)
- Dimensions (width/height) returned as strings (like price) due to numeric type
