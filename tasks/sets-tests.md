# Sets Tests

## Objective
Create comprehensive tests for the sets module (product hierarchy for icon/illustration sets with pricing, licensing, ownership, soft delete, and activation) following established SOA testing patterns.

## Plan

### 1. Branch Setup
- [x] Create new branch `claude/sets-tests`
- [x] Analyze Set module structure
- [x] Write this task file

### 2. Test Structure
- [x] Fix SetEntity allowedColumns (camelCase)
- [x] Fix SetRepository (remove stray character, add options parameter)
- [x] Fix SetService (add withSoftDeletable and withActivatable mixins, fix methods)
- [x] Create comprehensive tests:
  - [x] entity.test.js
  - [x] repository.test.js (contract only)
  - [x] repository.custom.test.js (custom methods)
  - [x] service.test.js

### 3. Module Analysis

**Entity Details:**
- **Entity**: SetEntity
- **Fields** (16 total):
  - id (primary key)
  - name (text)
  - price (numeric 10,2)
  - family_id (integer, FK to families)
  - license_id (integer, FK to licenses, default 21)
  - type_id (integer, FK to product_types)
  - style_id (integer, FK to styles)
  - team_id (integer, FK to teams)
  - unique_id (varchar 12, auto-generated)
  - user_id (integer, FK to users - owner)
  - description (text)
  - sort (integer, default 0)
  - is_active (boolean, default true)
  - created_at (timestamp with time zone)
  - updated_at (timestamp with time zone)
  - is_deleted (boolean, for soft delete)
- **Relations** (13 total):
  - popularity (PurchasedItemEntity)
  - family (FamilyEntity) - belongs to family_id
  - icons (IconEntity) - one-to-many
  - illustrations (IllustrationEntity) - one-to-many
  - owner (UserEntity) - belongs to user_id
  - teamType (TeamTypeEntity) - belongs to team_id
  - images (ImageEntity) - one-to-many
  - license (LicenseEntity) - belongs to license_id
  - productsType (ProductTypeEntity) - belongs to type_id
  - style (StyleEntity) - belongs to style_id
  - team (TeamEntity) - belongs to team_id
  - user (UserEntity) - duplicate of owner?
  - tags (TagEntity) - many-to-many
- **Purpose**: Product hierarchy - container for icons/illustrations within a family, with pricing and licensing

**Repository:**
- **Repository**: SetRepository (extends BaseRepository)
- **Model Name**: 'sets'
- **Custom Methods**:
  - findByUniqueId(uniqueId) - find by unique_id
  - findAllActive() - find active, non-deleted sets
- **Required Fix**: Add options parameter, remove stray character

**Service:**
- **Service**: SetService (extends BaseService)
- **Dependencies**: None
- **Custom Methods**:
  - getSetByUniqueId(uniqueId)
  - getAllActiveSets()
  - getSetsByFamilyId(familyId) - NEEDS REPOSITORY METHOD
- **Required Fix**: Add `withSoftDeletable` and `withActivatable` mixins, add options parameters

**Test Data Strategy:**
- Product entity with pricing, ownership, and family relationship
- Has soft delete (is_deleted) and activation (is_active)
- Has timestamps (created_at, updated_at)
- Has unique_id auto-generated field
- Test unique_id lookup
- Test soft delete/restore
- Test activation/deactivation
- Test price validation
- Test ownership tracking
- Test family relationship

**Contract Configuration:**
- `supportsSoftDelete: true` - Has is_deleted field
- `supportsActivation: true` - Has is_active field
- `supportsTimestamps: true` - Has created_at/updated_at
- `whereForUnique: (data) => ({ name: data.name, family_id: data.family_id })` - Unique by name + family
- `supportsRelations: true` - Test relation loading

### 4. Test Coverage

**Entity Tests:**
- Field mapping for 16 fields (camelCase)
- Verify all fields present in toJSON output
- Standard contract tests
- Test relation definitions (13 relations)

**Repository Tests:**
- Standard CRUD operations via contract (repository.test.js)
- Verify correct model wiring (sets)
- Test timestamp behavior
- Test soft delete behavior
- Custom method tests (repository.custom.test.js):
  - findByUniqueId
  - findAllActive

**Service Tests - Contract:**
- Standard service operations via contract
- Soft delete and restore tests
- Activation/deactivation tests
- Timestamp tests

**Service Tests - Custom (Set Management):**

1. **Unique ID Lookup:**
   - Test getSetByUniqueId()
   - Test unique_id auto-generation
   - Test unique_id persistence

2. **Active Sets:**
   - Test getAllActiveSets()
   - Verify only active + non-deleted sets returned
   - Test filtering behavior

3. **Family Relationship:**
   - Test creating sets with family_id
   - Test finding sets by family_id
   - Test family_id requirement

4. **Pricing Management:**
   - Test creating sets with prices
   - Test price precision (2 decimals)
   - Test price updates

5. **Ownership Tracking:**
   - Test creating sets with user_id
   - Test finding sets by owner
   - Test team_id assignment

6. **Type and Style:**
   - Test type_id assignment
   - Test style_id assignment
   - Test finding by type/style

7. **Licensing:**
   - Test default license_id (21)
   - Test custom license_id
   - Test license updates

8. **Soft Delete + Activation:**
   - Test soft delete deactivates
   - Test restore behavior
   - Test combination filtering (active + not deleted)

9. **Sorting:**
   - Test sort field default (0)
   - Test custom sort values
   - Test ordering by sort

### 5. Validation Rules

- **type_id**: Integer FK to product_types, nullable
- **style_id**: Integer FK to styles, nullable
- **team_id**: Integer FK to teams, nullable

- **user_id**: Integer FK to users, required
- **description**: Text, nullable
- **sort**: Integer, defaults to 0
- **is_active**: Boolean, defaults to true
- **is_deleted**: Boolean, for soft delete
- **Timestamps**: Automatically managed

## Notes
- Second module in product hierarchy (after families)
- Has soft delete AND activation (combined filtering)
- unique_id is auto-generated at DB level
- Price uses numeric(10,2) for precision
- Owner relationship via user_id
- Family relationship via family_id (required)
- Team relationship via team_id (optional)
- License relationship via license_id
- Type relationship via type_id (optional)
- Style relationship via style_id (optional)
- Contains icons and illustrations (one-to-many)
- Has 13 relations (more complex than families)
- Use separate files: repository.test.js and repository.custom.test.js
- Use user_id = 1 for all test seeds
- This continues Phase 2 (core product hierarchy)
