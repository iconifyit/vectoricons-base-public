      VectorIcons Backend API Documentation

      This documentation covers the core architecture and services of the VectorIcons
      icon marketplace backend. The system implements a Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)
      with event-driven patterns for scalability and maintainability.

  - name: Architecture Overview
    description: |
      **Layered Architecture:**
      - REST API Layer (Fastify)
      - SOA Service Layer (Services, Repositories, Entities)
      - Infrastructure Layer (Cache, Events, Access Control)
      - Data Layer (PostgreSQL, Redis)

      **Key Patterns:**
      - Entity/Repository/Service pattern for data access
      - Event-driven pub/sub for module communication
      - Adapter pattern for swappable cache/event backends
      - Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
