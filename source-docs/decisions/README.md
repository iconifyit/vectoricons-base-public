# Architecture Decision Records

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) documenting significant architectural decisions made in the VectorIcons.net Base SOA package.

## What is an ADR?

An Architecture Decision Record captures an important architectural decision along with its context and consequences. ADRs help teams and future maintainers understand why certain choices were made.

## ADR Format

Each ADR follows this structure:

- **Title**: Short descriptive name
- **Status**: Accepted, Proposed, Deprecated, or Superseded
- **Context**: The problem or situation requiring a decision
- **Decision**: The choice that was made
- **Consequences**: Positive and negative outcomes of the decision
- **Alternatives Considered**: Other options that were evaluated
